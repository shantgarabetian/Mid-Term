        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p> One of the most common everyday sports that people can play at any park, gym, or school court is basketball. Basketball is one of the most strenuous cardiovascular activities out there, and it ranks as high as running, jogging, swimming, or tennis when it comes to calories burned. Basketball involves constant movement, jumping, running, and quickly moving your feet. Playing basketball is one of the best and most enjoyable things you can do to stay in shape.</p>
        <p>This is a partial list of hobbies. A hobby is an activity, interest, or pastime that is undertaken for pleasure or relaxation, done during one's own time. This list includes only recognized hobbies that have been the subject of published discussions or that have organized membership associations. </p>

        <h3>Basketball With Friends</h3>
        <p>The hobby of basketball builds strength throughout your entire core, your legs, your quads, and your upper body. It requires a ton of stamina and a vast amount of energy to play, especially in a team game. Unlike other sports like baseball or even football, basketball involves constant motion. Many sports get broken up every few seconds as plays are drawn up and there are adjustments to be made. Some sports like soccer, tennis, and basketball involve constant movement with few breaks to be found.

        <p> I have been also interested in basketball because it is a sport that helps to make you healthy because it could be a form of exercise that can burn some calories. Besides on playing basketball I also enjoy watching basketball especially <a href="https://nba.com">NBA</a> games.</p>
